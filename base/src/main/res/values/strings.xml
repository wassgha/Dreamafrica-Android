\n

You may cancel your subscription as provided on the Website from time to time. TPD is the provider of the Services, which permits registered Users to purchase certain rights to access Stories for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms of Service. The foregoing reference to purchase of Stories is not a sale of Stories or a sale of a copy of Stories, and TPD and/or our applicable Contributors retain all rights and interest in the Stories. Readers will not own the Stories; Reader’s rights will be limited to the foregoing license regardless of the use of the word “purchase” or “sale.”\n

Prices for products offered via the Services (each, a “Product”) may change at any time, and the Services do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering. If a Story or other Product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is a refund in accordance with the timeframes and rules as set forth on the Website from time to time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your Product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by TPD.\n
\n
c. Billing and Payment Policy. All information that you provide to register with TPD including your credit card information or payment account information is subject to TPD’s Privacy Policy. We may use a third party payment service to bill you through an online account (your “Billing Account”) for your purchase of Stories or other Products in lieu of directly processing your credit card information. By submitting your payment account information, you grant TPD the right to store and process your information with the third party payment service, which it may change from time to time; you agree that TPD will not be responsible for any failures of the third party to adequately protect such information. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of third party payment service in addition to these Terms of Service. You acknowledge that we may change the third party payment service and move your information to other service providers that encrypt your information using secure socket layer technology (SSL) or other comparable security technology.\n
\n
d. Shipping and Risk of Loss. For physical goods that are shipped to you, unless otherwise indicated at the time of your purchase, shipping and handling fees are included with your order. Shipping dates and/or arrival times are only estimates. For loss/damage claims, you must notify TPD within 30 days of the date of your purchase if you believe all or part of your order is missing or damaged. Replacement of products and credits to your account for shipped merchandise claimed as not received are subject to our investigation, which may include postal-service notification. We will adjust your account at our discretion. Repeated claims of undelivered merchandise may result in the cancellation of your membership.\n
\n
e. Returns and Exchanges. If a Product is defective, you may return it during the applicable warranty period and we will send you a new item or credit your account. To request a refund, please contact us at support@thepearldream.com. When returning physical products, it is your responsibility to take reasonable care to see that the products are not damaged in transit and are received by us at our address as displayed on the Website. All refunds are subject to our shipping, return and exchange policies, as we may set forth from time to time.\n
\n
f. Refunds. Other than an expressly set forth on our Website as updated from time to time, TPD has no obligation to provide refunds or credits, but may grant them in certain circumstances, as a result of specific refund guarantee promotions, or to correct any errors made by TPD, in each case in TPD’s sole discretion.\n

The term “Content” means all information, text, images, data, links, software, Reviews, Listings, or other material accessible through the Website or Services, whether created by us or provided by another person for display on the Website or through the Services; for clarity “Content” includes Stories only to the extent expressly indicated herein.\n
\n
The Content may contain typographical errors, other inadvertent errors or inaccuracies. We reserve the right, but without obligation, to make changes to document names and Content (including Stories), descriptions or specifications of products or services, or other information without obligation to issue any notice of such changes.\n

Liability. We are not responsible or liable for the conduct of Users or for views, opinions and statements expressed in Content submitted for public display through our Services, such as through Public Areas. We do not prescreen information in Stories or Content posted to online discussion boards, forums or chat rooms (each, a “Public Area”). With respect to such Stories, or Content in Public Area, we are acting as a passive conduit for such distribution and are not responsible for Content.

\n
d. Lobbying. Federal law restricts lobbying activities by tax-exempt organizations. “Lobbying” includes certain activities intended to influence legislation. Content posted by Users does not constitute lobbying by TPD, but may constitute lobbying by you or an organization that you represent. You are responsible for complying with any applicable lobbying restrictions.\n

11. Release of The Pearl Dream.\n
\n
Neither TPD nor its affiliates or licensors is responsible for the conduct, whether online or offline, of any use of the Service. TPD expressly disclaims any liability or claims that may arise between Users of our Services. You are solely responsible for your interactions with all other Users and any disputes that arise from those interactions with other Users. TPD may monitor disputes between Users, but is not obligated to monitor, mediate, or resolve such disputes.\n
\n
Because TPD is not responsible for or involved in any contact between Readers and Contributors, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you hereby release TPD (and our officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind, known and unknown arising out of or in any way related with such disputes.\n
\n
If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”\n
\n
12. Minors.\n
TPD services are available only to, and may only be used by, individuals who are 18 years and older who can form legally binding contracts under applicable law. Individuals under the age of 18 can use our Services only in conjunction with and under the supervision of a Parent. In this case, the Parent is responsible for any and all activities of the Reader in connection with our Services.\n
\n
13. No Solicitation.\n
\n
Without limitation, the Service may not be used to solicit for any other business, website or service. You may not solicit, advertise for, or contact in any form Users for employment, contracting, or any other purpose not related to the Service facilitated through TPD without express written permission from TPD.\n
\n
You may not use the Service to collect usernames and/or email addresses of Users by electronic or other means without the express prior written consent of TPD.\n
\n

Furthermore, by posting Suggestions to any Public Area of the Website and/or the Services, you automatically grant TPD all rights necessary to prohibit any subsequent aggregation, display, copying, duplication, reproduction, or exploitation of the Suggestion on the Website and/or Services by any party for any purpose.\n
